Recently turned data engineer with a background in academic research (evolutionary quantitative genetics, [PhD thesis](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A842941&dswid=-2237) via statistical programming in pharma.
User of R, SQL, Python and SAS for work where there is a focus on data manipulation, visualisation and analysis, while I've also learnt the basics of other languages including Java and Kotlin in my spare time.
Most coding projects focus on my interest in cycling and the Zwift training/racing platform, including experiments and analysis of different in-game equipment.
